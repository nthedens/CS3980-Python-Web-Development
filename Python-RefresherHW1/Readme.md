### echo.py
The echo.py is meant to emulate the echo of an open space, it takes user input and returns the last three, then last 2, then last character of their input. In the case of an input less than 3 characters it returns all characters until it needs to remove one. The program use the function echo that takes a string and an integer that tells the number of repititions to perform, set to the default of 3. The function takes the last characters equal to the repititions value and prints to console the results removing one character at a time until it reaches the end.
